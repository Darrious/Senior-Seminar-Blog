Blockchain is a chain of blocks where blocks are digital pieces of information. These blocks can store information about transactions such as date, time, and dollar amount of a recent purchase. Blocks also store information about participants in a transaction. They store information that can distinguish them between other blocks using hashing.

Recently, I read an interesting article about the concept of blockchain voting and how effectient it would be. Results would be avalaible within minutes and there would be little room for voter fraud allegations. The election resutls would not only be tamper proof but also nearly instantaneous. Ethereum co-founder agrees that this technology should be adopted, but says this system will have significant technical challenges. One of the most difficult challenges that this technology faces is indentify verfication. This is needed to a avoid double voting and other kinds of fraud. Once this is securely implemented, this technology is a major improvement from current election processes. Users can verify that their vote is counted. Currently, a GDPR compliant prototype of this kind of system exists called Vocdoni. It is built on 'decentralized infracture' so that anyone can audit the code and voting processes.

Perhaps the 2020 presidential election, ridled with claims of voter fraud, will cause a large shift in the voting process.
