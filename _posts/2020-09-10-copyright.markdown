I think protecting intellectual property is *critical* for promoting innovation. People and business will focus less on researching and developing new ideas/products if they know their idea has no protection (and potentially less profit as a result). Without intellectual property protection, big corporations could steal smaller companies ideas. 

There are also many flaws with our current system. Mylan, the company that makes EpiPens, has a patent for the EpiPen auto-injector design that lasts until 2025. This means they can charge large amounts for EpiPens since they have zero competition. An argument can be made that this is an unethical application of the patent system as many people rely on the EpiPen.

One problem I have noticed with the US copyright system is that it is too complicated and expensive for individuals to enforce their rights. The law is very complex and lawyers are not cheap, especially if your lawyer is up against a team of top lawyers paid for by a corporation. From an economical, it is not worth it for most individuals to enforce their rights.
