The things discussed in the video have only become more relevant. Compare a 2009 sedan (like the one discussed in the video) to a 2020 vehicle. New vehicles have many times more computer systems than a car from 10 years ago. One thing that comes to my mind is a Tesla. The hacking possibilities are endless. Since it has an array of cameras and moniters around the vehicle, a hacker could monitor and watch these to see the drivers surroundings and their location (although it would be easier to just monitor the car via GPS). The vehicles self driving software could be hijacked and controlled. The list goes on and on. Even outside of Teslas, modern vehicles come with a plethora of computer systems.

Computer systems are slowly (maybe not so slowly) being implemeted in more and more products. Smart locks, alarm systems, devices such as Amazon Alexa, smart refrigerators, smart watches, smart glasses, and smart TV's (there's a lot of "smart" stuff now). This means there are more and more devices that can possibly be hacked for sensitive data. It will only grow from here. I often wonder what the future will hold. Will brain implant hacking be a legitamate concern for people living in 2030? My take away from all this is no matter how well you secure a device, there is always a way to infiltrate it.
