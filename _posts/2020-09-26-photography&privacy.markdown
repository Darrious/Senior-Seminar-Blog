Unknowingly ending up in the background of a photograph can be unsettling in many cases. I think the context of the photo is important. If the back of my head is visible 30 feet away in a vacation photo, it probably will not bother me. I might be more bothered if a photo is discretely taken of me at the exact moment I spill a hot coffee in my lap. There is spectrum ranging from “I don’t mind” to “that is extremely invasive” although the lines are a bit blurred. There are many shades of grey in between.

I think any individual that takes photographs of me in my apartment/home (private property) against my consent is invading my privacy (unless they have a legal reason to be there). I think the same thing applies to the workplace (because private property). I do not think my privacy is being invaded if I am included in a large panorama of a sports stadium since I am in a public place and I am not being singled out. On the other hand, I think some photographs taken in public places can be invasive. Let us say a discrete portrait photo is taken of me on the street for no apparent reason and posted to the front page of a popular website with personal and identifying information listed below. Although I was in a public place, and there is nothing legally wrong with taking the picture, I think the photographer was in the wrong and invaded my privacy.

One big factor is your relationship with the photographer. I care less if the photographer is a close family member or friend, but even this situation has some nuance. Is the photo embarrassing or compromising to my reputation? Was the photo taken discretely or was I asked? Will they simply keep the photo in their camera roll or will it be posted to social media or shown to others? All these factors determine how I feel about the situation. They also make it hard to define hard rules on what is and is not invasive photography. Ultimately, situations must be examined on an individual basis.
